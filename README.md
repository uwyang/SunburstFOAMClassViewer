# OutlineShadow

## Introduction: 
I've been interested in Generative art since the age of flash. Many frame work have crossed my path, including Flash, Processing,Processing.js, Java(in its pure and original form), and now I'm trying to make some generative art pieces with FOAM.

## UI

User may specify random step length, step opacity(alpha) and color. 
You may also save your creation. 

## Technologies used: 

At first, I was very keen on incooperating as many node packages as possible, because, well, looks good on resume. But I have thought twice and this is mostly pure javascript+FOAM. I have used an image-outline package to generate outline of points in an .png file.

- [FOAM2 Javascript Framework](https://github.com/foam-framework/foam2 "FOAM2 Github page")
- [npm package image-outline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-outline "npm image-outline page")
- JavaScript ES6
- HTML5 Canvas Element
